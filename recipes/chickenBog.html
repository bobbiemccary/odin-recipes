    <h2><u>Description:</u></h2>

        <p>This is my family's traditional take on a South Carolina low country classic.
        Chicken Bog is a dish with african roots consisting of rice, chicken, and sausage.
        My family recipe ommits the sausage and uses yellow saffron rice. <br> 
        Typical with this region's dishes, its beauty is found within its simplicity.</p>
